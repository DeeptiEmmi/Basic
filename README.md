# "HELLO-WORLD" & CALCULATOR
# Experiment 1
## AIM :
a) to print Hello world 

b) to make a basic calculator 

## THEORY :
C++ is a general-purpose, high-performance programming language that builds on the foundation of the C language. Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s at Bell Labs, C++ is a cross-platform language used to create high-performance applications. It supports object-oriented programming, making it a versatile tool for various types of software development.
This experiment consists of two practicals namely printing of "Hello World" and making of calculator program.

### Experiment 1 a)
In the hello world program , the *cout* function from the iostream library is commonly used to print output to the console. The iostream library in C++ is a part of the Standard Library and provides functionalities for input and output operations.The *using namespace std;* directive is used to avoid the need to prefix standard library names with *std::* .

### Experiment 1 b)
Basic arithmatic operations like addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/) were used to create the program.Here *cin* function is used to store the data input from the user in a variable.
